    <h2> THE CREATION OF THE TIKAU EMIRATE </h2>
    <p> <b>Tikau Emirate</b> is inhabited mostly by <b> Karai-Karai </b> people. Archeological and ethno-linguistic sources categorize 
        the Karai-Karai as part of the Chadic group of languages who left Yemen and came through Egypt to settle on Mega-Chad shores searching 
        for Agricultural, pastures and hunting lands.
        Oral tradition assigns the origin of Karai-Karai to a different account. It relates that, the Karai-Karai shifted west ward from Yemen
        in the Middle East along with the kanuri and other groups. The Kisri  legend especially links this migration to the successive advents 
        of the great monotheist religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
        Some Karai-Karai splinter groups cover the eastern plains of present day Jigawa (Gwaram) and Bauchi (Shira) States. Others settle in the 
        arable western plains of yobe state, around the 15th century and founded the various Karai-Karai clans of Tikau, Langawa, Degubi, Pakarau and Dazigau.
        A man called <b> Shikau founded Tikau dynasty </b>, other rulers reigned in succession notably, <b>Ndiirama Jiji and Ndiirama Mataata</b>.
        <b>Mataata</b> was confronted and defeated by the <b>first Borno Caliphate in 1958</b>. His successor <b>Warkati</b> was the first to adopt
        the Kanuri title <b> Mai </b>.On the strength of their cultural and economic commonality, <b> Langawa, Degubi, Pakarau and Dazigua </b> 
        coalesced into virile Commonwealth under the leadership of <b> Mai Saaban (1873 – 1923) of Tikau </b>. <b>Saaban’s</b> expansion of the
        Tikau frontiers was only halted by the arrival of the british Colonial forces at the dawn of the 20th century.
    </p>
    <p> During the reign of Saaban’s son,<b> Mai Grema (1924 – 1945) </b>, Tikau was included in the new Fika Emirate. So too were other chieftaincies
        within the defunct Karai-Karai Commonwealth. Tikau continued to remain as chiefdom, its first Western Educated chief, the son of Mai Grema,<b> Alhaji Abubakar Shuwa Ibn Grema </b>
        was elevated to the status of a District Head in 1962. His appointment as a district head partially restored shikau’s pre-colonial portion of 
        land separated from Tikau by the British.
        <b>Alhaji Abubakar Shuwa, the 10th ruler of Tikau</b>, succeeded his father Mai Grema from 1945. He reigned as village head of Tikau up to 1962. 
        when he was appointed District of Nangere. He was elevated to the status of Emir of Tikau in 1993; however this was short lived as the emirate 
        was soon dissolved.
        The Emirate was re-instated in 2001 and the Mai of Tikau was re-appointed and elevated to the status of second class.
        He died on Tuesday , 17th July, 2001, and his son <b> Alhaji Muhammadu Abubakar Ibn Grema, the 11th ruler of Tikau </b> succeeded him as <b>
        <b>Mai of Tikau on 21st july, 2001 and was turbaned on Saturday 11th may, 2002.</b>
        <br> <b>Alhaji Muhammadu Abubakar Ibn Grema was upgraded to first class Emir on 28th may, 2007 by Alhaji Bukar Abba Ibrahim, FNIQS, the then Governor of Yobe state.</b>
        On 5th August 2010, Alhaji Muhammadu Abubakar Ibn Grema was appointed the first Chancellor of Yobe State University, Damaturu, 
        by Alhaji Ibrahim Gaidam, FCNA, FCPA, Executive Governor of Yobe State.
