    <h2>THE HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF TIKAU EMIRATE </h2>
    <p><b>ON AN OCCASION</b> like this, History's ventured tellalls burst with fodder for curious ears. Well, Tikau Emirate is no accident of history.
        It is the assured end of  Destiny. It began as a trifle, a flash in the pan. Bereft of the camera or the video, its origin, like that of all other
        Africans, is translucent. Here were a people with a veritable, lived experience, without the camera, the mechanical wit to freeze the past to a lucid recall.
        Yet, there is no total loss. The lacuna is mitigated by the human mind and ear. The ear pre-dates a grand father, so goes a Haasa saying. Oral
        tradition and written records say much more Tikau.<br>
        Archeological and ethno-linguistic postulates categorize the Karai-Karai as part of the Chadic group of languages. In early times, 
        a huge water body, called the Mega-Chad,gradually shrank to the present-day Lake Chad. Before it shrank, people on its shores were culturally 
        homogenous and cohesive with a common language. People began to move in separate groups, into the rich plains left by the receding water, searching 
        for agricultural and hunting lands. As groups separated, their dialects changed. With time, each group evolved a different language, all of the languages 
        sharing certain vocabularies from the defunct Mega- Language.  Thus, today, where the Karai-karai word for horse is doku, the Ngizim say duka and the 
        Hausa say doki. Where the Ngizim refer to the eye as da, the Bolewa say udo, the Hausa Say Ido. The Karai-Karai sai ido. Other examples abound. Each group 
        founded its exclusive settlements hence the emergence of cities and towns and villages in most of the Chad Basin. Going by this account, Tikau is one such.

    <p> Oral tradition assigns the origin of Tikau to a different account. It is related that the Karai-karai shifted westward from Yemen in the Middle East,along with
        the Kanuri and other groups. The Kisrah Legend,especially, links this migration to the successive advents of the great monotheist religions of Judaism,Christianity
        and Islam. Legend Aside,there exists evidence of migration from Egypt,where,as early as the year 1052 A.D . banu-Hilal nomadic Arabs commenced their 
        migration from Egypt to the pastoral Chadic plains,thereby involving into the president-day Shuwa-Arabs.Whether their origin lay in the Middle East as 
        maintained by legend or on the shores of the Mega Chad since the genesis of Man, as asserted by Archeology and ethnography, the subsequent 
        metamorphoses of the Chadic peoples entailed migrations. Some Karai-Karai splintered to cover the eastern plains of present-day Jigawa (Gwaram) and
        Bauchi (Shira) States. Others settled in the arable western plains of Yobe State. Here,around the 15th century (about 400 years ago), they founded the various 
        Karai-Karai clans of Tikau, Langawa, Degubi, Fagarau and Dazigau, which though in its present-day suburbs, pre-dated the founding of Potiskum. 
        Each of the various entities eventually developed into a powerful Chiefdom.A man called Shyekau founded the Tikau dynasty. Other rulers reigned in succession,
        notably, Ndiirama Jiji and Ndiirama Mataata. Mataata was confronted and defeated by the first Borno Caliphate in 1758 (242 years ago). His 
        successor, Warkati, was the first to adopt the Kanuri title Mai,following the friendly relations that ensued between Tikau and Borno.
